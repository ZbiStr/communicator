# Protocol

This document demonstrates the communication protocol between the server and the client.

## Way of communication

The communication takes place in the Erlang 24.3.4 environment.

## Sent messages 

Given below is a description of messages that are being sent during the communication.

### login

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Client ->> Server: login(Username, Address, Password)
Server ->> Server: checking if the user has a password
alt success
Server ->> Client: ok
else invalid password
Server ->> Client: wrong_password
else user already exists
Server ->> Klient: already_exists
else maximum number of clients 
Serwer ->> Klient: max_reached
end
```

The client calls the server function in the form of login(Username, Address, Password). If the query has been processed correctly, the server will answer "ok". If the user with a given name already exists, the server will answer "already_exists". If the password is incorrect, the server will answer "wrong_password". If the maximum number of users is reached, the server will answer "max_reached".

### logout

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Client ->> Server: logout(Username)
Server ->> Client: ok
```
The client calls the server funcition in the form of logout(Username). If the query has been processed correctly, the server will respond "ok".

### send

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant Client1
participant Server
note right of Client2: ...
Client1 ->> Server: send_message(all, Time, From, Message, MsgId)
par Server to Client2
Server->> Client2: {Time, From, Message, {MsgId, Klient2}}
Client2 ->> Server: {msg_confirm_from_client, {MsgId, Client2}}
and Server to ClientN
Server->>ClientN: {Time, From, Message, {MsgId, KlientN}}
ClientN ->> Server: {msg_confirm_from_client, {MsgId, ClientN}}
end
Server ->> Client1: {msg_confirm_from_server, MsgId}
note right of Client2: ...
```

The client calls the server function in the form of send_message(all, Time, From, Message, MsgId). If the query has been processed correctly, the serber will send a message to all logged in users in the form of {Time, From, Message, {MsgId, ClientN}}.

### send <Username>

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Client1 ->> Server: wyszukanie uÅ¼ytkownika
alt sukces
Client1 ->> Server: send_message(Username, Time, From, Message, MsgId)
Server ->> Client2: {Time, From, Message, MsgId}
par
Client2->> Server: {msg_confirm_from_client, MsgId}
and
Server ->> Client1: {msg_confirm_from_server, MsgId}
end
else error
Server ->> Client1: does_not_exist
end

```

Client1 asks the server if the users exists. If so, it calls the server function of the form send_message(Username, Time, From, Message, MsgId). The server forwards the message to Client2 in the form {Time, From, Message, MsgId}, receives confirmation of receiving the message from Client2 in the form {msg_confirm_from_client, MsgId}. Client2 receives confirmation of receiving messages from the server in the form {msg_confirm_from_server, MsgId}. If no such user exists, the server will reply with "does_not_exist".

### users

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Client ->> Server: show_active_users() 
Server ->> Client: [ActiveUsers]
```

The client calls the server function in the form of show_active_users(). In response, the server sends [ActiveUsers].

### set_pass

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Client ->> Server: set_password(Name, Password)  
Server ->> Client: ok
```

The client calls the server function in the form of set_password(Name, Password). In response, the server sends "ok".

### history

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Client ->> Server: checking if the users is registrated
alt success
Client ->> Server: user_history(Username) 
Server ->> Client: [{Time, From, Message},...]  
end
```

The client calls the server function in the form of user_history(Username). In response, the server sends a list of saved messages in the form [{Time, From, Message}, ...].
